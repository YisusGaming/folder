CLI Program to manage folders written in Rust.

**Folder** is a CLI tool that allows you manage folders in your filesystem. It's cross-platform.

Currently, only creating and deleting folders is supported. More operations soon!

Creating a folder looks like this:

```sh
folder new dirname
```

that'll create the path `dirname/`.

Deleting folders looks like this:

```sh
folder del dirname
```

that'll delete the path `dirname/`.
